 # ðŸ§  Smart Career Counselor AI

An AI-powered career guidance assistant that helps users explore career paths tailored to their skills, interests, and educational background. This project uses modern LLM features such as Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Structured Output, and Function Calling to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **Prompting**: Engages users through intelligent, structured prompts to gather inputs like skills, education, and interests.
- âœ… **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Retrieves real-time career data from documents or job databases using vector search (FAISS/ChromaDB).
- âœ… **Structured Output**: Presents results in a clean, structured format like job cards (JSON or UI).
- âœ… **Function Calling**: Dynamically calls external APIs or functions to fetch course recommendations or skill-matching scores.

4. **Output**: User receives structured job cards with:
    - Job Title
    - Average Salary
    - Required Skills
    - Recommended Courses
